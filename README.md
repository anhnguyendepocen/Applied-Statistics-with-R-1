# Applied-Statistics-with-R
Resources and updates to the book Applied Statistics with R: A Practical Guide for the Life Sciences by Justin C. Touchon.

If you've come here, presumably that means you are working your way through my book. I hope you are enjoying it! 

Here you will find pages dedicated to the exercises described at the end of each chapter, as well as updates about code that might become obsolete or that needs to be updated. Since R is a living and changing language, it is possible that some of what I wrote in the book may not work by the time you are reading it.  Hopefully you can find what you need here to get back on track! Click on the .md files above to read sample answers to the assignments at the end of each chapter, or to see updates to code in different chapters.

The other main reason you might be here is to download the RxP.csv file that you need to work through all the code in the book. To download the file, click the link above, then in the next page click the "Raw" button to open the file in your web browser. Save that file to your computer, and you will be good to go!
