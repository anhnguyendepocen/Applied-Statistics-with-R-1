# Applied-Statistics-with-R
Resources and updates to the book Applied Statistics with R: A Practical Guide for the Life Sciences by Justin C. Touchon.

If you've come here, presumably that means you are working your way through my book. I hope you are enjoying it! 

Here you will find pages dedicated to the exercises described at the end of each chapter, as well as updates about code that might become obsolete or that needs to be updated. Since R is a living and changing language, it is possible that some of what I wrote in the book may not work by the time you are reading it.  Hopefully you can find what you need here to get back on track!
